## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for learning the core concepts of AI and ML through hands-on projects. The programs are designed to give you experience with different types of machine learning techniques, from basic regression models to advanced neural networks and NLP tasks. 

The projects are part of an ongoing training program organized by **N.I.E.T College**, focused on equipping students with the skills needed to implement AI/ML solutions.

## Folder Contents

Here is an overview of the contents in this repository:

- **`Chatbot/`**: Code for building a **simple chatbot** using machine learning. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user inputs.
- **`House price prediction/`**: Implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, etc. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- **`Image Classification/`**: This folder contains code for classifying images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with libraries such as **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. It covers the fundamentals of image data processing and model training.
- **`Sentiment Analysis/`**: This project involves text classification using machine learning algorithms like **Logistic Regression** or **Naive Bayes** to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) of given text data.
- **`Stock Price Prediction/`**: A machine learning program that predicts stock prices using **Time Series analysis**. It explores techniques like **ARIMA** and **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for forecasting stock market trends.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Installation

To run the programs in this repository, you'll need to set up your environment and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user007ash/aiml-training.git
cd aiml-training
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment
Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment for this project to manage dependencies efficiently. You can use **venv** (built-in) or **conda** (if using Anaconda).

For **venv** (Python's built-in environment manager):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries using **pip**. Most dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary packages like **scikit-learn**, **tensorflow**, **keras**, etc.

## Usage

Each folder in the repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to execute the various AI and ML programs. You can run the code directly by following these steps:

### 1. Run a Python Script:
For example, to run the **House Price Prediction** model, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python script:

```bash
cd House\ price\ prediction
python house_price_prediction.py
```

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks:
You can also work with **Jupyter Notebooks** if you prefer an interactive environment. To run the Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a browser window where you can select the notebook you want to run.

### 3. Modify the Code:
Feel free to modify the code for your own learning. If you're working on a project like **Stock Price Prediction**, try changing the dataset or tweaking model parameters to explore how they affect performance.
